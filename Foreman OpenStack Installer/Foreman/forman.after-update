After updating foreman-openstack-installer we may have to manually do:

# foreman-rake db:migrate

And from the UI go to Configure -> Puppet classes and then click on "Import from <host>"

Just go for the "Production" update:

production | Update: | ceilometer, galera, glance, heat, horizon, keystone, and swift
