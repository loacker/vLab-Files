Notes on CDN channels:
======================

Register machines to all the relevant repos:
--------------------------------------------

subscription-manager register --auto-attach
subscription-manager repos --disable=*
subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-6-server-rpms --enable=rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms --enable=rhel-6-server-openstack-4.0-rpms --enable=rhel-lb-for-rhel-6-server-rpms --enable=rhel-6-server-optional-rpms rhel-6-server-mrg-messaging-2-rpms

Install facter from RH-COMMON:
------------------------------

yum install facter
subscription-manager repos --disable=rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms

Please, see notes below about disabling RH-COMMON after installing facter from it.

Check python-qpid version is 0.19 in all the hosts:
---------------------------------------------------
yum -q list python-qpid

Please, see notes below for details.


1. Errors when setting CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF to a VLAN interface in RHEL OSP 4 (Patch): 
==============================================================================================

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1143906

NOTE: 
-----

We are setting up a Linux Bridge called br801 and using the eth6.801 in the compute hosts as a port. We are doing the same in the Neutron node. This is due to a limitation where Packstack can't configure different network interface names for the GRE tunnel in different hosts (answer file setting CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF).

Because of the above, the following patch is optional.

Apply this manually in the controller node (where packstack is run from) to fix it:

File: /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/packstack/puppet/templates/neutron_ovs_agent_gre.pp

After "if "%(CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF)s" {"

replace:

  $localip = $ipaddress_%(CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF)s

by:

  $iface = regsubst('%(CONFIG_NEUTRON_OVS_TUNNEL_IF)s', '[\.\-\:]', '_', 'G')
  $localip = inline_template("<%%= scope.lookupvar('::ipaddress_${iface}') %%>")


2. Don't install L2 agent on api node by default (Patch): 
=========================================================

https://github.com/stackforge/packstack/commit/bd36954

Apply this manually in the controller node (where packstack is run from) to fix it:

File: /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/packstack/plugins/neutron_350.py

# local ip error

To solve the problem with packstack trying to set up the OVS agent on the controller, I patched the packstack neutron plugin: 

I replaced the following line (805) in create_l2_agent_manifests:

   for host in api_hosts | compute_hosts | dhcp_hosts | l3_hosts:

With:

   for host in compute_hosts | dhcp_hosts | l3_hosts:

Note:
-----

Possibly related to this, the following needs to be added manually in the controller node in the file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini at the very bottom:

[SECURITYGROUP]
firewall_driver=neutron.agent.linux.iptables_firewall.OVSHybridIptablesFirewallDriver


3. Need to use python-qpid 0.18 (Workaround)
============================================

neutron-server startup fails if using python-qpid 0.22 from rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms

python-qpid-0.18-12.el6.noarch from rhel-6-server-mrg-messaging-2-rpms is needed.

Make sure rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms is disabled and rhel-6-server-mrg-messaging-2-rpms is enabled in all hosts before proceeding with the Packstack deployment.

Note:
-----

If already installed: To solve the python-qpid issue, I ran the following across all the machines:

 for x in {76..78}; do
   cat <<-EOF | ssh 192.177.0.$x
   yum -y remove python-qpid
   yum-config-manager --disable rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms
   yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-mrg-messaging-2-rpms
   yum -y install python-qpid
   EOF
 done

This removes python-qpid installed from the RH-COMMON channel, disables the RH-COMMON channel, enables the MRG channel, and then re-installs python-qpid (this time the correct version).

4. Need an updated Facter for RHEL OSP 4 (Workaround)
=====================================================

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1143885

Version facter-1.6.6-1.el6_4.x86_64 from rhel-6-server-openstack-4.0-rpms is old.

facter-1.7.6-2.el6sat.x86_64 from rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms is needed.

Install facter manually in all the hosts before proceeding to with the Packstack deployment.

Disable the channel after facter is installed:

subscription-manager repos --disable=rhel-6-server-rh-common-rpms
